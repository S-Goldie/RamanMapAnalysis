# RamanMapAnalysis

Raman spectroscopy is a common tool for the analysis of carbon nanomaterials, however like many micro-scale measurements it is not automatically clear how spectra collected from single points correspond to the entire bulk material.
By collecting many points this problem can be addressed. This was the subject of a research project undertaken at the University of Durham in the group of Karl Coleman.

A code has been developed to fit many independent Raman spectra from carbon nanomaterials, returning key peak parameters from the D, G and 2D peaks. This Python code is available for download.
Requires Python3.7 and modules:
 - lmfit  =  https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/
 - matplotlib  =  https://matplotlib.org/
 - tkinter  =  https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html

To download the complete program that requires no installation of Python or modules click on the 'New Releases' tab to the right for a fully functinal .zip file.
The python program is still advised for stability and massively reduced disk space if possible.


This project has also been expanded to consider the statistical significance of different data sets for the analysis of nanomaterials. Raw data available as .zip folders for each type of material studied.
