# RamanMapAnalysis

Raman spectroscopy is a common tool for the analysis of carbon nanomaterials, however like many micro-scale measurements it is not automatically clear how spectra collected from single points correspond to the entire bulk material.
By collecting many points this problem can be addressed. This was the subject of a research project undertaken at the University of Durham in the group of Karl Coleman.

A code has been developed to fit many independent Raman spectra from carbon nanomaterials, returning key peak parameters from the D, G and 2D peaks. This Python code is available for download.
Requires Python3.7 and modules:
 - lmfit  =  https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/
 - matplotlib  =  https://matplotlib.org/
 - tkinter  =  https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html

A stand alone .exe executable program is in preparation.


This project has also been expanded to consider the statistical significance of different data sets for the analysis of nanomaterials. Further details and raw data available in the folder 'Statistical Analysis'.
